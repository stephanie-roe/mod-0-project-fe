## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

One point from the video that really resonated with me was the notion of the "myth of the brilliant developer". As someone new to this field and this subject, programming can seem intimidating. The myth of the brilliant developer suggests that developers do not behold super-human intellect, rather their success is found in their growth mindset, which allows them to approach challenges creatively and collaborate when needed to find a solution.

Another point that stood out to me in the video was when the interviewee explained her approach to solving problems with a growth mindset. She mentioned making an itemized list in her mind, which allowed her to figure out what steps to take to problem solve. This is something I have been doing for years but never identified as a trait of growth mindset!


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

As shared in the last prompt, I have a systematic approach to problem solving including listing out challenges in an effort to come up with a game plan in which I hope to find a solution. Beyond that, I am one who takes time for a lot of reflection on my behaviors, why they occur, if they're productive and how I can change them if they are not. That said, one way in which I currently do not demonstrate growth mindset is that I can be self critical to a fault. While I know that with effort I am capable of learning and accomplishing anything, when I face a challenge that I am struggling to solve, I can be unnecessarily hard on myself. In the video, the speaker mentioned how even she has fixed mindset days and has learned to acknowledge them, give herself rest and know that the following day will be different. I hope as I grow within this program, I can learn to do the same.



3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I appreciate that the training wheels are beginning to come off in this stage of the project. Knowing I have a support system should I need it gave me peace of mind when working through this section, but this structure really facilitated my learning as I was eager and inclined to revisit material previously covered to answer my own questions.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is one that compares true and false values. Comparison operators are used to determine the outcome in this scenario. In daily life, a conditional statement would be "If the temperature is below 30, I will wear my coat". In a web application, conditional statements could be used in the login screen of any web  platform. If the credentials entered match the credentials on file, the result would be true and the user would be guided to their dashboard. If the credentials entered do not match the credentials on file, the result would be false and the user might me prompted to try again or reset their username or password.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, you set the first conditional and follow with either `else if` of `else` depending on the desired outcome. JavaScript will run through the conditions until the rules are satisfied and execute the code at that place.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I would like more practice on conditionals when two variables are in play (similar to the pizza exercise). I was able to work through the if-statements.js exercise easily but would like to gain more confidence with logical operators.
