## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

As an individual learner who finds great value in researching and cultivating solutions on my own, the articles shed light on the importance of time when it comes to asking questions. In previous learning environments,"dumb question" culture prevailed and as a result I became very shy and reserved, usually waiting too long to ask questions or not asking them at all. These articles reinforce the approachable culture at Turing and create a safe space to learn. I appreciate the guidance on how to navigate an issue before asking for help. This approach allows me time to try and find a solution on my own (which works well with my learning style), while also teaching me to manage my time appropriately, collaborate with others and see my instructors and colleagues as a vital resource.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
In this section, I learned about **Numbers**, **Strings** and **Booleans**.

**Numbers** are a primitive data type that allows us to perform manipulations on all forms of numbers (negative, decimal, whole).

**Strings** are a primitive data type that can include numbers, letters and special characters so long as they begin and end with either single *('')* or double quotes *("")*.

**Booleans** are a primitive data type that can only be assigned a *true* or *false* value (think logic). I like to think of these as an approach to a yes/no question that needs to be addressed in the code.  These are helpful in determining which script to run when provided with input.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Double backslashes *(//)* or a bracket-style combination of backslashes and asterisks *(/*  */)* deactivate content in a JavaScript file, allowing developers to leave meaningful commentary that provides guidance, shares rationale or leaves insight regarding *why* the code is written the way it is.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a category of data with a unique name that allows us to change and reference values over time. If I was explaining this concept to a 5 year old, I would use an example of fruits versus vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are two separate variables and the types of fruits of vegetables we think of would represent the values, which in this case would be **strings**.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Like many, an app I use (arguably too) frequently is Instagram. Three likely variables are `userName`, `likes` and `credentials`.
`userName` would be a **string**, representing each individual users @, `likes` would be a **number** that represents the number of likes each post has and `credentials` would be a **boolean** applied when the user logs in. If the login credentials match what's in the database, the result would be *true* and subsequently script would run to proceed to the user's main page. If the login credentials do not match, the result would be *false* and a script prompting the user to re-enter the correct credentials would run.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

In short, **concatenation** is the act of joining together two variables. These can include **strings** and **numbers**.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Sticking with the example of Instagram, concatenation is likely used when gathering the list of likes on post. In specific, it would be used when compiling a list of `userName` **strings** to communicate with the user who all has liked their post.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I'm wondering how booleans are incorporated to cue when to run certain scripts and how those scripts are defined in relation to the booleans.
