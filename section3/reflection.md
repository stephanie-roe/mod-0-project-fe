## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

I really enjoyed it! I appreciate that we were guided to a reputable resource (MDN), but were expected to conduct our own research and do a bit of self-learning. It was also interesting to have access to other methods than the ones we focused on in this lesson. It was a slight challenge but one I was eager to take given the tools I was provided with.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

One application I use regularly is Untappd. This app allows you to track and keep a record of beers you've tried, including notes and a ranking. An array that is likely employed in this app would be list of beers that have been checked in. Each new entry would be saved as a string and the updated total after adding a new entry would essentially display the length property of the array.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is an action that can be performed to the elements within an array. These methods are a part of Javascript and essentially act as a tool to perform a number of different operations on an array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop allows us to execute the same code several times without entering it repetitively. This simplifies our code, keeping it more streamlined and allows for more efficiency when writing code that could otherwise be repetitive. A loop in conjunction with an array is useful for a myriad of reasons when a message needs to be repeated with only certain elements changing line to line. An example of this would be a message received in an automated fashion. For instance, I would like to send a personalized message out to everyone on my subscribers list. Using a loop in in conjunction to an array would allow me to print the same message several times, with the customization of each subscriber's name embedded in the copy.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Think of Javascript as an automatic cookie jar. If we give it a command, it will give us one cookie by default. However, there's a way in which we can give the automatic cookie jar one special command and it will give us five cookies! These special commands are called *loops*.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I would like more practice with incorporating conditionals into for loops like we did in the last prompt for the loops-arrays.js exercise. It was fun and challenging. In my independent study, I noticed there are different types of loops (for each, etc.), I would like to explore the applications of those as well!
